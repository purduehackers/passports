# passports

The Purdue Hackers passport is a physical, passport-shaped booklet, containing a "data page" with its owner's information and 16 pages for stamps, each a reference to some defining part of Purdue Hackers.

Passports are handmade by their owners at hour-long passport-making ceremonies, which run every two weeks at Hack Night. Hackers sign up for a passport-making ceremony by creating their personalized data page.

Every passport has an NFC sticker embedded in its cover, which has an ID written to it. This NFC sticker is the heart of a passport: it allows it to become a legitimate identifying document within our universe, and unique infrastructure to be built around it.
