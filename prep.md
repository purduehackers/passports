# Passport ceremony prep

All our passport ceremony prep is done in the Knowledge Lab.

First, we grab the submitted data pages from an R2 bucket, download them to the Knowledge Lab computer, and then combine them into a PDF. All the stamp pages are already stored as a PDF on that computer.

Then, we store the number of people who are making a passport that evening in our big big brains.

Prep takes anywhere from 1 to 2 hours, with an average of 90 minutes. We try to avoid having more than 10 people at one passport ceremony, because that would increase both the prep time and especially the ceremony event time.

## Cut the cover design

- Open Cricut Design Space and load up the "final circle" file
- Select "On Mat" and continue
- Mirror the design
- Connect to the Maker 3
- Select "Foil iron on"
- Grab the heat transfer vinyl and use the Cricut Paper Trimmer to cut 4-5ish inches of it. A good visual indication is you want the edge of the vinyl to roughly align with the left edge of the trimmer. Then, take the piece of vinyl you just cut and cut it again in half. (idk the difference between lengthwise and crosswise but basically you want it to still be 4ish inches, just not 12 inches long)
- Place one of them **shiny side down** (gray part facing you) on the Cricut mat at the top left corner, and load it into the Cricut Maker 3
- Run the operation. After it's done, the design should be cut into the vinyl, and you should be able to see it from both sides.
- Repeat until you've cut enough for everyone

## Cut the cardstock layer

- Load "cardstock layers template" in Cricut Design Space
- Select "On Mat" and continue
- Connect to the Maker 3
- Select "Cardstock (for intricate cuts)"
- Place one 12x12 sheet of black cardstock on the Cricut mat
- Run the operation. After it's done, you should have two pieces of cardstock cut to 17.4x12.4cm
- Repeat until you have enough cardstock layer sheets
- Add the scrap paper to a scrap pile or recycle it

## Laminate the cards

- Turn on the laminatior, set it to 3mm. Wait for it to be ready
  - As of writing, the Knowledge Lab has 3mm laminating sheets, but sometimes they have 5mm. Make sure you set it to the setting that matches the sheets they have. If they have both types, prefer 3mm, but it doesn't make a difference on the final passport either way.
- Place An 8.5x11 sheet of black cardstock inside the lamination plastic
- Run it though. There's a correct direction to run it though but idk what it is. Both directions have worked fine in the past
- Repeat until you've made enough. One sheet will make enough for 2 passports.

## Cut the laminated cards

- Load "laminated cards" in Cricut Design Space
- Select "On Mat" and continue
- Make sure the layout is 2x2. Sometimes the software will put 3 cards on one row and 1 card on another, but this will overflow over your page.
- Connect to the Maker 3
- Select "Kraft Board"
- Set the pressure to "More"
- Place one laminated sheet on the Cricut mat
- Run the operation. After it's done, you should have 4 small laminated cards
  - You should be able to take all of them out of the sheet, but sometimes the Cricut machine won't properly cut through. If this happens, DO NOT run it through again. Instead, grab an XActo knife and cut along the existing cut lines by hand.
- Repeat until you're through all your sheets
- Dispose of the scrap laminated sheets

## Cut the faux leather

- Go to a cutting-safe surface
- Unroll the faux leather and place the acrylic template on the top left corner
- Hold it down tight and cut around the template using an XActo knife
- Repeat until you've cut enough. The roll should be long long enough for two columns of cutting
- Dimensions: 17.8x12.4cm

## Round your corners

- Round every corner of every cardstock layer, laminated layer, and faux leather. Place each corner inside the "S" slot of the corner rounder and press down.

## Print the data pages

- Load the white cardstock into Tray 1 and print the data pages that were previously combined into a PDF. make sure you're **NOT** printing double-sided

## Print the stamp pages

- Open the PDF containing passport stamp pages
- Make sure you **ARE** printing double-sided
- Print enough copies for everyone who registered

## (Optional) cut stamp pages

If you have extra time want to save time during the ceremony event, you can cut all the stamp pages yourself. The cutting step always takes longer than expected during passport ceremonies.

_Do not_ pre-cut data pages, as it will make it more difficult to apply book tape during the ceremony event.

- Grab a ruler and an XActo knife. Set all pages aside except for one
- Place the ruler all the way across the page, lining up with the printed design. Start with the shorter side of the paper
- Hold the ruler down tight and run an XActo knife all the way across the page. Start at one edge and end at another. Do not start or end in the middle of the page
- If the paper doesn't separate, keep holding the ruler down and repeat until it does. (Printer paper should usually cut after one round)

If you do this step, make sure to also round the corners of all the pages you cut, otherwise people won't do it at the ceremony event, and for those who do it will take longer
