- Letter size printer paper
  - This is available to us via the Knowledge Lab
- Legal size white cardstock
  - This is available to us via the Knowledge Lab
  - Letter size cardstock works too. We only use legal because that's what the Knowledge Lab has. Though we actually found that the larger legal size makes it easier to apply book tape and neatly lay out materials during ceremonies.

- 1/8 clear acrylic laser cut to 17.8x12.4cm
  - We laser cut this at the Bechtel Center. This is used as the "template" for cutting the faux leather to the right size. You can use anything as long as it's cut to 17.8x12.4cm, but ideally it should have a little bit of weight, because you'll have to hold it down and cut around it.
