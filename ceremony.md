# Passport ceremony event

This is what passport ceremony attendees do over ~1 hour.

## Lay book tape

- Cut a couple inches of book tape, enough to cover the length of a data page.
- Place the book tape on top of your data page. It won't cover the whole page; try to center it.
- Flip your data page over and apply another round of tape to around the same spot on the back. This is less precise; it's mostly used as a counterweight

This is very hard to do right without crinkling your tape and making it look bad. Here's a strat for avoiding that, which I've gotten ~60% consistent with:

- Don't cut the book tape too big. It should be bigger than the data page but not way bigger.
- Hold it as straight as you can
- Carefully and slowly lay down the very top of the tape on the page
- Gently let the rest of the tape fall down

If done right, the tape should be on with no crinkles. But if you don't get it right it's okay.

## Cut your data page

- Grab a ruler and an XActo knife
- Place the ruler all the way across the page, lining up with the printed design. Start with the shorter side of the paper
- Hold the ruler down tight and run an XActo knife all the way across the page. Start at one edge and end at another. Do not start or end in the middle of the page
- If the paper doesn't separate, keep holding the ruler down and repeat until it does. (Cardstock should usually cut after a few rounds)

## Cut your stamp pages

This only applies if this wasn't done during prep.

- Grab a ruler and an XActo knife. Set all pages aside except for one
- Repeat all steps from "Cut your data page", but for each printed design on all your stamp pages. Make sure you're only working on one sheet at a time, and you're not accidentally stacking pages.

## Round your corners

- For each page whose corners are not rounded, place each corner in the "S" slot of the corner rounder and press down to round the corner

## Put your pages together

- Set your leather aside
- Fold all your pages in half, inward. Place each page inside the other such that the designs match
- Fold the layer of black cardstock in half and place it on the back, such that it's wrapping all other pages

You should have something resembling a booklet, and when you flip through it all the designs should match.

## Sew your pages together

For organizers:

- Make sure the sewing machine is set up, plugged in, and threaded with white thread
- Make sure the thread from both the needle and the bobbin are always pulled out & sticking out to the left of the sewing machine. Especially make sure of this after each person uses the sewing machine, otherwise the needle will unthread.
- Make sure the width is set to 3 and the needle is set to straight

For attendees:

- Open your booklet to the middle page. Make your booklet "stand up" and hold each page exactly where you want them to be
- Place 4 wonder clips, one on each corner
- Place your booklet underneath the needle of the sewing machine at the top of the booklet and middle of the pages
- Use the pedal to sew through the booklet. Go one third of the way down the booklet
- Hold the gray lip thing in front of you all the way down, then use the pedal again to reverse back to the top of the booklet
- Go back down the middle, all the way down to the bottom of the page
- Once you're at the bottom, reverse back about one third of the way from the bottom
- Use the wheel to your right to lift the needle up
- Pull your booklet far out. You will feel some resistance because there's still thread attached. That's okay
- Use thread scissors to cut the thread

## Weed your vinyl

- Set your sewed booklet aside
- Grab your gold vinyl and a Cricut weeding tool
- Turn your vinyl shiny side down (gray side up)
- Use the weeding tool to peel a corner up a little bit
- Use your hands to peel the rest of the vinyl up, moving slowly. Everything should peel off except for the design, revealing a clear ahesive layer
- Be careful around the I, L, and P, because those like to get peeled up too. If you notice them start to be peeled up, use the weeding tool to cut it off, letting the letters fall back down.
- Once the vinyl is peeled off, use the weeding tool to remove all pieces of vinyl inside the letters, such as inside the P or A. These will be very small pieces, so use the tweezers to take them off once you gain leverage with the weeding tool.

## Heat press

- (If applicable) turn the heat press on. Set the temperature to 255 degrees F and the time to 30 seconds. Wait for it to heat up.
- Fold your leather in half, into the shape of a passport matching your pages
- Place the newly-formed adhesive on your leather, aligning the design exactly where you will want it. (I recommend centering it the best you can)
- Place your leather, with the design on top, on top of the heat press mat
- Place a layer of butcher paper on top
- Grab the heat press and place it on top of the butcher paper where your leather & design are
- Start the 30-second timer
- Press down with all of your weight. Once the timer is up, return the heat press iron to where it came from
- Take the butcher paper off and set it aside
- Take your leather off the mat. It should be very hot to the touch. WAIT until it's room temperature or a little bit warm
- Slowly peel the plastic off. The design should be adhered to the leather
- If the design isn't adhered to the leather, repeat all steps but for 8 seconds instead of 30 seconds

## Glue

For organizers:

- Place many sheets of scrap paper, and have a few extra pieces of scrap paper around. Make sure nobody gets any glue on any surface that is not scrap paper.

For attendees:

- Bring all your materials thus far to the gluing station
- Grab two laminated cards
- Take an NFC sticker and place it on one of the laminated cards where you'll want to scan your passport
  - Most people put it in the middle, but some put it on one of the corners
- Rip off a piece of scrap paper and fold it in half. This is your Advanced Glue Smearer
- Take the bottle of book glue and make an "S" shape of glue on both laminated cards. Make sure to place the glue on the side with the NFC sticker, on the card with the NFC sticker.
  - DO NOT use too much glue. You need less glue than you think.
- Use your Advanced Glue Smearer to smear the glue on every part of the laminated cards. Make sure to get the corners
- Place your leather somewhere else on the scrap papers, and place your laminated cards on each side of the inside of the leather
  - Try to align it to the outer corners
- Grab the glue again, and make another S on the laminated cards you just glued to your leather. (Keep them glued during this process)
- Smear the glue again, just like you did the first time
- Take the rest of your booklet and place it on top of the laminated cards. Align everything as well as you can. There should be very little of your inner booklet sticking out of the cover, but there maybe ~1mm sticking out in some places. Try to make it perfect, but it's okay if it's not perfect.
- Bring your finished passport to an organizer, who will activate your passport.

## Press

- Immediately find a weight, like your backpack or a stack of books, and place your passport under it. You can press it closed or open, but results are often better if you do it open (to the middle page)
- Keep your passport under this weight for 24 hours
